## Basic Network Security

All devices are connected to the router.
The router assigns your network ip addresses. A layer 3.

### Weaknesses

1. The internet
2. Device connected
3. Wireless router
4. Connection to other networks i.e. workstations at work

## Terms

SOHO - Small office home office.

## Set Up Security

How to secure devices and networks using devices and 3rd party software.

## Search for

Things we want to find or search in networks

## Information Gathering

First steps for hackers is to gathers as much OSINT as possible.
This online information gathering.
Using this data hackers can try and catch you in attacks. Either sending you a email virus with something you are interested in as the title. Or saying where you work. Creating files on the companies and people they are targetting will help make the overall job easier.

OSINT - open source information

The OSINT Framework is a tool that will search for usernames and emails across all sorts of social media.

`twint` twitter search

`. IP address`

## Denial of Service

Prevent a server from servicing real requests from clients by flooding traffic to the server.

### Network DOS

Fill up the network connection with enough bandwidth until devices cant keep up.

DDOS Distributed DOS is one of these - where you flood the server.

### Application DOS

Find bugs and vulnerabilities and send requests to the server that crash it.

### Operational Technology (OT) DOS

This aims DOS at business systems and processing hardware and software.
