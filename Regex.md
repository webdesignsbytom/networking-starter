# Regex

[abc] will match a, b, and c (every occurrence of each letter)

[abc]zz will match azz, bzz, and czz.

You can also use a - dash to define ranges:
[a-c]zz is the same as above.

And then you can combine ranges together:
[a-cx-z]zz will match azz, bzz, czz, xzz, yzz, and zzz.

Most notably, this can be used to match any alphabetical character:
[a-zA-Z] will match any single letter (lowercase or uppercase).

You can use numbers too:
file[1-3] will match file1, file2, and file3.

Then, there is a way to exclude characters from a charset with the ^ hat symbol, and include everything else.
[^k]ing will match ring, sing, $ing, but not king.

Of course, you can exclude charsets, not just single characters.
[^a-c]at will match fat and hat, but not bat or cat.

Note 1: Don't confuse strings with charsets. The charset [abc] will match the string abc, but also cba and ca. It doesn't match the string, but rather every occurrence of the specified characters in that string.

The wildcard that is used to match any single character (except the line break) is the . dot. That means that a.c will match aac, abc, a0c, a!c, and so on.

Also, you can set a character as optional in your pattern using the ? question mark. That means that abc? will match ab and abc, since the c is optional.

Note: If you want to search for . a literal dot, you have to escape it with a \ reverse slash. That means that a.c will match a.c, but also abc, a@c, and so on. But a\.c will match just a.c.

There are easier ways to match bigger charsets. For example, \d is used to match any single digit. Here's a reference:

\d matches a digit, like 9
\D matches a non-digit, like A or @
\w matches an alphanumeric character, like a or 3
\W matches a non-alphanumeric character, like ! or #
\s matches a whitespace character (spaces, tabs, and line breaks)
\S matches everything else (alphanumeric characters and symbols)

Note: Underscores _ are included in the \w metacharacter and not in \W. That means that \w will match every single character in test_file.

Often we want a pattern that matches many characters of a single type in a row, and we can do that with repetitions. For example, {2} is used to match the preceding character (or metacharacter, or charset) two times in a row. That means that z{2} will match exactly zz.

Here's a reference for each repetition along with how many times it matches the preceding pattern:

{12} - exactly 12 times.
{1,5} - 1 to 5 times.
{2,} - 2 or more times.
* - 0 or more times.
+ - 1 or more times.
